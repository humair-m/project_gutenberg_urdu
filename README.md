## Overview

**Project Gutenberg Urdu** is an ongoing open-source initiative aimed at creating a comprehensive Urdu translation of the original **Project Gutenberg** collection. The goal is to make classic literature and public domain books accessible to the Urdu-speaking community in their native language.

Project Gutenberg is a volunteer-driven project offering free eBooks, primarily in English, with a vast collection of literary works. This project builds upon that foundation by translating and adapting these works into Urdu, promoting literacy, education, and cultural enrichment for Urdu readers worldwide.
